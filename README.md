# Frame-analysis-for-BP-in-Matlab
This is the code that was used in my project "Constructing a Method for Measuring Blood Pressure Using a Video Camera" at RAYS under the direction of Professor Hamed Hamid Muhammed from the department of Technology and Health at the Royal Institute of Technology. The code is written by me, my colleague Samuel Tober, RAYS counselor Isak Nilsson and Professor Muhammed. The code is written in Matlab. The main code is Blodtryck_V03.m, with use of RGB.m and Contrast.m. 

Two other important functions are Fseries.m and Fseriesval.m that we have not written ourselves. The author is Matt Tearle who is a Training Content Developer at The MathWorks.
